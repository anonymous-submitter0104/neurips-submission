## Why the Need for Indic MMLU

The rise of large language models (LLMs) has enabled advanced **synthetic data generation**, including:

* Building LLM-based frameworks for **data curation and sandboxing**
* Generating reasoning and coding examples in non-English languages
* Creating SFT datasets, as well as off-policy datasets for **RLHF, DPO, GRPO**-style training

To fully leverage these capabilities for Indian languages, we need LLMs with at least **limited native proficiency** in these languages. Such models allow us to generate high-quality, culturally-aligned datasets, create virtual personas to introduce nuanced constructs, and maintain **full control and flexibility** over the synthetic data pipeline.

### Data Distillation for Indian Languages

Data distillation provides a practical approach to achieve this:

* **Easier and cleaner access to world knowledge** from state-of-the-art LLMs
* **Domain control and flexibility** to shape datasets according to cultural and linguistic requirements
* Embedding **strong Indian values** into datasets more effectively than via custom pipelines
* Creating safety datasets that mitigate **anti-Indian stances** and promote positive responses

**Distillation** is the process of generating data from large models to produce **task-specific, high-quality, and culturally-aligned datasets**. Using distillation, we can apply various synthetic data augmentation strategies, such as:

* Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning
* Multi-turn conversational setups for richer data
* Summaries and diverse QA pairs
* Incorporation of strong Indian values through **virtual Indian personas**
* Other augmentations, including translations and language-specific refinements

### The Role of Indic MMLU

Before deploying LLMs for such Indian-language data generation, we first need to **evaluate their cross-lingual knowledge transfer capabilities**. Indic MMLU serves this purpose by providing a benchmark to test how well models understand Indian languages, rather than merely translating English content.

While previous efforts have translated MMLU into Indian languages, none have **released their methodology**. Indic MMLU is the first benchmark to provide:

* **Open recipe and open code** for translations
* Coverage of **22 Indian languages**
* A fully transparent and **reproducible evaluation setup**

This ensures that models can be assessed rigorously for genuine Indian-language understanding, forming a **foundation for culturally-aware synthetic data pipelines** in future research.

## What this dataset has on offer

Large language models are often benchmarked only on English datasets, which leaves open the question of whether they can *actually* understand Indian languages beyond surface-level translation.

The **Indic MMLU dataset** bridges this gap by:

* Translating the widely used **[CAIS/MMLU](https://huggingface.co/datasets/cais/mmlu) benchmark** into **22 Indian languages**.
* Enhancing those translations with high-quality open-source LLM refinement.
* Providing a reproducible evaluation setup for **measuring open-source models across 16 Indic languages (evaluated subset)**.

If a model’s score on an Indic version is close to its score on the original English MMLU, it indicates **genuine language understanding** and strong cross-lingual generalization.

---

## Coverage

* **Dataset scope:** 22 Indic languages (full benchmark availability).
* **Evaluation scope:** 16 Indic languages + English (practically evaluated with ~24 open-source LLMs).

This separation ensures the dataset is **broad and inclusive**, while evaluation focuses on the languages with the most immediate support and resources.

---

## Overview

* **Source benchmark:** CAIS/MMLU (general knowledge QA benchmark).
* **Target:** 22 Indic languages + English (translated test set).
* **Workflow:** Machine translation → LLM-based translation enhancement → embedding comparison → Persona based LLM-as-judge Scores → Correlation between Embeddings and LLM as Judge → human/linguist rating and automated evaluation.
* **Deliverables:** Enhanced translated `.jsonl` datasets, per-language embeddings, cosine similarity reports, teacher/linguist ratings, model evaluation scores and visualizations (radar plots).

---

## Key principles applied

1. **Preserve semantic parity:** Questions remain semantically the same as English; only language changes.
2. **Quality control:** Model-Based Automated checks (embeddings, math correctness) + human linguist ratings.
3. **Reproducibility:** Dockerized inference environment, scriptable pipeline, and clear CLI commands.
4. **Transparency:** We provide similarity metrics to demonstrate translation fidelity and teacher ratings to highlight linguistic quality.

---

## High-level pipeline (what we did)

1. **Translate** the CAIS/MMLU test set to each Indic language using *IndicTrans2* (baseline MT).
2. **Enhance** those translations using an open-source LLM with task-specific instructions (to correct phrasing, clarify ambiguous translations, preserve math expressions, and maintain answer choices alignment).
3. **Embed** both the original English items and the (enhanced) translated items with the same embedding model.
4. **Compare** embeddings using cosine similarity to measure semantic closeness.
5. **LLM as Judge and Human review**: linguists/teachers rated samples for language quality, math correctness, and coherence.
6. **Evaluate models**: run ~24 open-source LLMs across all languages using the lm-eval framework and visualize results (radar plots, top-3 per language).

## Indic MMLU Construction Algorithm

To complement the pseudo-code, the following flowchart provides a **visual overview of the Indic MMLU pipeline**. It clearly illustrates the step-by-step workflow, starting from the English MMLU dataset and moving through translation, enhancement, evaluation, and validation:

* **Translation Stage:** The English MMLU instance is translated into Indic languages using specialist MT.
* **Enhancement Stage:** Translations are refined with large-scale LLMs for improved fluency and alignment.
* **LLM Based Judging Phase:** Three types of evaluation are conducted — *fluency by native language experts, subject correctness by domain experts, and alignment by coherence judges*.
* **Validation Stage:** Embedding similarity checks, n-gram metrics (BLEU, ROUGE, ChrF++), and discrepancy detection ensure quality.
* **Final Output:** A validated Indic MMLU dataset instance ready for benchmarking.

# Translation Algorithm 

```
Input:
  original_mmlu
  target_languages
  instructions

For each language L in target_languages:
    translated = translate(original_mmlu, tgt=L)
    enhanced = enhance_using_llm(translated, instructions)

    eng_emb = embed(original_mmlu)
    trans_emb = embed(enhanced)
    sim_scores = cosine_similarity(eng_emb, trans_emb)

    llm_scores = LLM_as_Judge(original_mmlu, translated)

    consistency = consistency_check(sim_scores, llm_scores)

    If consistency is poor:
        human_ratings = rate_sample(enhanced)
    Else:
        accept enhanced

Aggregate all scores:
    combine sim_scores, llm_scores, human_ratings
    compute per-language model scores

Produce visualizations:
    generate charts and plots for cross-language comparison

Output:
    per-language evaluation scores
    visualizations

```

This visual representation makes it easier to understand how the **algorithmic steps, human evaluation, and automated checks** come together to ensure translation quality and dataset reliability.

### Summary of LLM-as-Judge Ratings

To evaluate translation quality systematically, we employed **LLMs as judges**, operating under three carefully designed expert personas:

* **Math Expert Persona** → Rated mathematical correctness, terminology, and conceptual fidelity.
* **Linguistic Expert Persona** → Assessed fluency, grammar, idiomatic usage, and naturalness of the translation.
* **Coherence Expert Persona** → Evaluated semantic alignment, logical flow, and clarity between English and the target language.

**What we measured:**

* Language quality, fluency, and linguistic suitability.
* Mathematical correctness and fidelity of technical content.
* Overall coherence and semantic alignment with the English source.

**How to read the table:**

* Ratings are on a **1–10 scale**, where higher scores reflect better translation and enhancement quality.
* Most languages achieved **consistently high averages (>8.9)**, showing strong quality after enhancement.
* A few outliers suggest areas where further targeted refinement may be beneficial.

---

## Cosine similarity 

* Cosine similarity gives a quick automated signal of semantic closeness between the translated/enhanced items and their English originals.
* Typical mean similarities range from ~0.76 to 0.85 across languages; higher means closer embeddings (better semantic preservation).
* Use the similarity scores as a triage: low similarity → manual review; high similarity → likely semantically faithful.

Workflow:

1. **Environment Setup:** Dockerized `vllm/vllm-openai` for reproducibility.
2. **Framework:** `lm-eval` for standardized evaluation.
3. **Metrics:** per-language accuracy, top-3 rankings per language, aggregate averages.
4. **Visualization:** radar plots for each language and comparative top-3 plots.

---

## Important Note

* **Indic MMLU Dataset = 22 Indian languages**
* **Current Model Evaluation = 16 Indian languages + English**
* Work is ongoing to expand the evaluation to cover all 22 languages.

## How to reproduce (quick checklist)

1. Prepare the English CAIS/MMLU test set (`.jsonl` with IDs).
2. Run `trans_mmlu.py` to produce per-language MT outputs.
3. Run `async_infr.py` with the enhancement task to obtain human-readable improved translations.
4. Generate embeddings for both English and enhanced translations.
5. Run `calculate_cosine_similarity.py` to produce similarity reports.
6. Optionally run human/linguist rating orchestration for additional quality assessment.
7. Evaluate models with `lm-eval` and generate visualizations.

---

## Best practices & caveats

* **Math and formatting:** preserve mathematical expressions and numerals during translation—these are critical for correctness.
* **Choice alignment:** ensure answer choices remain in the same order and map to the same ground-truth labels.
* **Human review:** automated metrics are helpful but not sufficient; include periodic linguist sampling.
* **Constrained inference:** use deterministic LLM settings for enhancement (lower temperature, consistent decoding) to reduce hallucination.
