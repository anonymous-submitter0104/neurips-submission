## Curation Pipeline Overview

### Pipeline Diagram
![Curation Pipeline](/readme-resources/data-curation.png)

### Description of Stages

1. **Raw Corpus Construction**

   * Aggregate large-scale text from publicly available sources (English + Hindi).
2. **Deduplication and Cleaning**

   * NeMo Curator deduplication (DCLM)
   * Filter by word/character distribution statistics (FWE filtering)
3. **Quality Filtering**

   * Document-level filtering: removal of boilerplate, low-information pages, and noise
   * Language ID filtering (restricting to English + Hindi)
4. **Indian Language Adaptation**

   * Language-specific tokenization and normalization for Hindi
   * Script unification for consistent Unicode handling
5. **Final Curated Dataset**

   * High-quality, domain-diverse corpus passed to training


## Evaluation Procedure

To rigorously assess the impact of our **curation pipeline**, we conducted a controlled evaluation comparing models trained on **conventional datasets** versus **curated datasets**.

**Purpose:**
The evaluation aims to quantify the benefit of data curation on model performance across multiple reasoning and knowledge benchmarks, isolating the effect of data quality from scale.

### Benchmarks Used:
We selected widely recognized benchmarks to capture diverse aspects of LLM capabilities:

* **[ARC Challenge & ARC Easy](https://huggingface.co/datasets/allenai/ai2_arc)** – reasoning-focused multiple-choice questions. 
* **[HellaSwag (English & Hindi)](https://huggingface.co/datasets/Rowan/hellaswag)** – commonsense reasoning and next-event prediction.
* **[MMLU (English & Hindi)](https://huggingface.co/datasets/cais/mmlu)** – multitask knowledge evaluation across academic and professional subjects.

### Evaluation Strategy:

* For this experiment, we selected the [Param-1](https://huggingface.co/bharatgenai/Param-1) pre-trained checkpoint, trained on 5T tokens, as our baseline due to its bilingual capabilities, making it well-suited for our evaluation. We then performed extended continual pretraining on this model using 2T tokens, drawn from the DCLM corpus, with 30% of the data translated into Hindi, under both conventional and curated data conditions.
* Both datasets were **matched in size (2T tokens)** to ensure that performance differences reflect the effect of curation rather than data volume.
* Performance was evaluated using standard benchmark metrics to measure gains in reasoning, multilingual understanding, and robustness.

### Key Expectations:
We anticipate that models trained on curated datasets will demonstrate:

1. Higher accuracy across all benchmarks.
2. Improved performance on **low-resource and multilingual settings** (e.g., Hindi variants).
3. Reduced propagation of low-quality, toxic, or redundant content, contributing to safer and more reliable outputs.

This evaluation framework establishes a **clear, reproducible methodology** for testing the efficacy of data curation, providing actionable insights for both ongoing model development and future dataset construction.


## Ablation Experiment 1: Evaluating the Efficacy of the Curation Pipeline

For this ablation study, we selected a **pre-trained checkpoint of an open-source LLM, [Param-1](https://huggingface.co/bharatgenai/Param-1)**, a **2.9B-parameter bilingual model** supporting English and Hindi. This checkpoint was trained on **5T tokens**, providing a strong multilingual baseline for our evaluation.

> [Scaling Law for Language Models Training Considering Batch Size](https://arxiv.org/html/2412.01505),
> [Language models scale reliably with over-training and on downstream tasks](https://www.emergentmind.com/papers/2403.08540)

### Model Details:

* **Model:** Param-1 Pre-trained Checkpoint (2.9B parameters)
* **Checkpoint Source:** [Hugging Face: Param-1](https://huggingface.co/bharatgenai/Param-1)
* **Training Recipe:** As described in the [Param Paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.13390)
* **Pretraining Tokens:** Original pretraining: 5T tokens; extended continual pretraining for ablation: 2T tokens

### Training Data Composition

To systematically evaluate the effect of data curation, we conducted **extended continual pretraining** on 2T tokens under **two controlled conditions**:

1. **Conventional Corpus (Uncurated)**

   * Constructed directly from raw text with minimal preprocessing (tokenization, basic normalization).
   * The 2T-token subset was sampled from the [DCLM corpus](https://github.com/mlfoundations/dclm), with **30% of tokens translated into Hindi** to maintain bilingual coverage.
   * No additional quality filters were applied, ensuring a baseline reflecting typical large-scale pretraining data.

2. **Curated Corpus (Curation Applied)**

   * Derived from the same underlying sources as the conventional corpus.
   * Processed through the **NeMo Curator pipeline**, which applies multiple quality control steps:

     * Deduplication
     * Heuristic-based filtering
     * PII redaction
     * Toxicity filtering
     * Quality scoring (low, medium, high)
   * A fully curated **2T-token subset** was selected, strictly matching the conventional corpus in size to isolate the effect of curation.

### Key Design Considerations:

* Both datasets contain **exactly 2T tokens**, eliminating confounding effects of scale.
* By maintaining identical token counts, any observed performance differences can be confidently attributed to **data quality and curation**.
* Inclusion of **30% Hindi tokens** ensures that the evaluation captures bilingual performance, addressing potential reviewer concerns regarding language coverage.

### Results Obtained: Conventional vs Curated

We evaluated models trained on both conventional datasets (raw corpus with minimal preprocessing) and curated datasets (data refined with targeted filtering and quality improvements). The goal was to compare their performance across widely used benchmarks for LLM evaluation.

**Benchmark Scores**

| **Model**      | **ARC Challenge** | **ARC Easy** | **Hella Swag** | **Hella Swag Hi** | **MMLU** | **MMLU Hi** |
|----------------|------------------:|--------------:|----------------:|------------------:|---------:|------------:|
| Conventional   | 46.5              | 73.6          | 73.5            | 28.9              | 41.3     | 26.2        |
| Curated        | 53.6              | 74.2          | 73.8            | 41.4              | 46.2     | 34.6        |

### Observations

1. **Consistent Improvement Across Benchmarks:**
   Models trained on the curated corpus outperform those trained on the conventional corpus across all evaluated benchmarks, demonstrating the positive impact of data curation.

2. **Significant Gains in Low-Resource / Multilingual Settings:**
   The largest relative improvements are observed in **HellaSwag Hi** (Hindi) and **MMLU Hi**, with scores increasing from 28.9 → 41.4 and 26.2 → 34.6, respectively. This highlights that curation is particularly beneficial for low-resource and non-English data.

3. **Marginal Gains in High-Resource English Benchmarks:**
   Improvements in ARC Challenge, ARC Easy, and HellaSwag (English) are smaller but consistent, indicating that curation enhances overall model quality, even for already high-quality data.

4. **Effect of Quality Filtering:**
   The gains suggest that removing low-quality, redundant, and toxic content through the curation pipeline allows the model to better utilize training tokens, improving generalization and robustness.

### Conclusion

The ablation experiment demonstrates that **data curation has a measurable, positive effect on LLM performance**:

* **Curated datasets consistently outperform conventional datasets**, confirming that quality matters as much as quantity in large-scale pretraining.
* **Bilingual and low-resource performance benefits the most**, underlining the importance of careful curation for multilingual corpora.
* These results validate the **NeMo curation pipeline** as an effective tool for improving downstream LLM performance, providing strong justification for its adoption in future model training.

## Ablation Experiment 2: Toxicity Evaluation

### Objective 
To evaluate the effect of data curation on model safety, we tested the **Param-1 model** after **extended continual pretraining on 2T curated tokens**. The pretraining used the curated dataset derived from the DCLM corpus (with 30% Hindi translations) to ensure bilingual coverage. This checkpoint reflects the combined effect of high-quality curated data and instruction tuning.

We assessed toxicity using the **Toxigen** benchmark within the **LLM360 Safety360** suite. This framework measures both **explicit and implicit toxic outputs** through adversarial prompts across identity-based and general categories. The objective of this experiment is to quantify the **effectiveness of toxicity mitigation** in Param-1 relative to other models of similar scale.

![Toxicity Sample](/readme-resources/toxic-comparison)

### Key Findings

* **Lower or Comparable Toxicity:** Param-1 consistently exhibits **lower or comparable toxicity rates** relative to other multilingual baselines.
* **Qualitative Behavior:** The model avoids generating stereotype-amplifying content, producing **neutral, helpful, and culturally respectful responses**, particularly in sensitive scenarios.
* **Impact of Curation Pipeline:** These results validate the effectiveness of our **curation and instruction-tuning pipeline**, which explicitly targets safe, high-quality content in both English and Hindi.

### Broader Implications

Our evaluation shows that Param-1 maintains **strong and consistent performance** across linguistic, reasoning, and culturally grounded tasks. By testing on both standard English benchmarks and **culturally adapted Hindi and multilingual datasets**, we provide a **robust assessment of the model’s generalization and domain-specific capabilities**.

### Conclusion

These results demonstrate that **extended continual pretraining on curated data improves both safety and performance**, establishing Param-1 as a **competitive, culturally aware foundation model** suitable for diverse real-world applications.

## Conventional vs Curated Data Sample

The Following is an example of a Assamese Text Pre-Curation and Post-Curation:
![Curation Sample](/readme-resources/curation.png)

### Observation

After the curation process, the dataset was significantly cleaned and standardized to improve model training. All HTML and markup tags such as `<div>`, `<br>`, `<i>`, `<b>`, and `<span>` were removed, leaving only readable text, while extraneous punctuation and repeated special symbols like `**`, `%%`, and `!!` were eliminated to produce more natural sentences. Redundant or repeated phrases were merged or removed to reduce overfitting, and line breaks or formatting artifacts were smoothed to ensure coherent, continuous sentences. Non-linguistic metadata, including authorship markers, instructional notes, or bracketed annotations, was stripped to focus solely on meaningful content. Token normalization was applied to unify encoding, spacing, punctuation, and Unicode scripts, minimizing inconsistencies across multilingual text. Additionally, potential toxic or inappropriate content was filtered to ensure safer and culturally neutral data. Overall, these curation steps enhanced the quality, readability, and consistency of the corpus, making it more suitable for downstream model training.
